# VP BMR Speaker Arm

---

![example_image](/preview.png)

Simple speaker arm incorporating a Tectonic BMR (TEBM35C02-6B, same model as those in the Valve Index) for use with a Vive Pro headset headstrap.

Uses the built-in DAC and speaker arm connections of the Vive Pro headset and headstrap. 

The speaker clip may need minor resizing in the slicer to result in a part that snaps correctly over the speaker arm.
